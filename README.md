# CypherStorm üîê

CypherStorm is a powerful, flexible cryptographic suite that allows you to securely compress and encrypt files and directories using various algorithms. Built with Go, it provides a seamless CLI experience for file security operations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Compression Algorithms**

  - GZIP (fast, widely supported)
  - ZSTD (excellent compression ratio/speed)
  - LZ4 (extremely fast)
  - BZIP2 (high compression ratio)
  - LZMA (highest compression ratio)

- **Strong Encryption Options**

  - AES-256-GCM (fast, secure)
  - ChaCha20-Poly1305 (modern, excellent for mobile)
  - XChaCha20-Poly1305 (extended nonce version)
  - AES-256-CBC with HMAC
  - Twofish

- **File Hashing**

  - SHA-256
  - SHA-512
  - BLAKE2b
  - SHA3-256
  - BLAKE3

- **Advanced Features**
  - Stream processing for files larger than RAM
  - Progress tracking
  - Flexible key management
  - Directory archival support

## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
